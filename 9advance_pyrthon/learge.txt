India, officially the Republic of India,[j][20] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country
 by area; the most populous country since 2023;[21] and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most 
 populous democracy.[22][23][24] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest,
  and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal,
   and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka 
   and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28] 
Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse.[29]
 Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving 
 gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit
 , an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[31][32] Its hymns recorded the early 
 dawnings of Hinduism in India.[33] India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[34] By 400 
 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders 
 unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.
